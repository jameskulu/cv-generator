    <h1>Check Your Email</h1>
    <p>We've sent a message to {{email}} with a link to activate your account.
    <h3>Didn't get an email?</h3>
    <p>If you don't see an email from us within a few minutes, a few things could have happened:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The email is in your spam folder. (Sometimes things get lost in there.) The email address you entered had a
        mistake or typo. (Happens to the best of us.)</li>
      <li>You accidentally gave us another email address. (Usually a work or personal one you meant.)</li>
      <li>We can't deliver the email to this address. (Usually because of corporate firewalls or filtering)</li>
    </ul>
